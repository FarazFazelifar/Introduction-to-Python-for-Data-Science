# Introduction to Python Programming for Data Science

## Course Overview
Welcome to the **Introduction to Python Programming for Data Science** course! This repository contains all course materials, including lesson notes and Jupyter notebooks, to help you develop a solid foundation in Python and essential data science concepts.

### Key Learning Objectives
- Understand and apply Python syntax and core programming principles.
- Learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for structured code design.
- Work with APIs to fetch and parse real-world data in JSON format.
- Perform data analysis using NumPy and pandas.
- Create visualizations with matplotlib to present insights effectively.
- Develop a final project integrating all learned skills.

## Course Structure
This course consists of **15 sessions**, covering the following topics:

| #  | Topic                         | Main Focus |

| 10 | File Handling                   | Reading/writing files, storing API data (CSV, JSON). |
| 11 | NumPy Basics                    | Arrays vs. lists, vectorized operations, slicing arrays. |
| 12 | pandas Basics                   | DataFrames, reading CSV, filtering. |
| 13 | Data Cleaning & Visualization    | Missing data handling, matplotlib basics, plotting. |
| 14 | Integration & Review             | Combining OOP, API, and data analysis skills. |
| 15 | Final Project Presentations      | Student demos, wrap-up, and next steps. |

## Hands-on Projects
Throughout the course, students will complete several mini-projects, culminating in a final capstone project.
